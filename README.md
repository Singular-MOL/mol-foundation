# Law of Minimal Ontological Load (MOL)
Universal meta-principle of directed self-organization in complex systems

MOL explains the fundamental problem of modern science: why the growth of the Universe's structure does not lead to chaos, but instead produces stable, coherent, and functionally significant configurations - from atoms and proteins to living organisms, cognitive systems, and social institutions.

## 🎯 Fundamental Principle
MOL states: Any stable system evolves toward a state with minimal ontological load (O(ℰ)) while preserving functional integrity (ℐ ≥ ℐ_min).

E* = argmin O(ℰ) subject to: ℐ ≥ ℐ_min, C ≥ C_min

where:
- ℰ — operational ontology of the system
- O(ℰ) — measure of non-functional redundancy  
- ℐ — informational/functional integrity
- C — topological connectivity

> "Reality prefers the most economical way of being."

## 🧩 Periodic Table of Meta-Principles
MOL is implemented through the ontological plane shift operator (Φ) and a system of 11 universal principles:

| Category | Principles | Function |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| 🔄 DYNAMICS (Process Φ) | PPD, PCR, PAD | Managing transitions and phase jumps |
| 🏛️ STRUCTURE (Space) | PFE, PLAO, PNCF | Organizing hierarchical systems and economy |
| 💡 INFORMATION (Essence) | PDC, PSR, PICC | Processing, compressing, and stabilizing information |
| ⏳ TIME/SYMMETRY (Beginning) | PAA, PHD | Symmetry breaking and evolutionary directionality |

### Two Documentation Versions Available:

[📖 **Quick Reference**](metaprinciples/MOL_Principles_Guide.md) - Concise overview of all 11 principles

[📚 **Complete Guide**](metaprinciples/full_principles_guide.md) - Full detailed descriptions with diagnostic matrices and practical examples

## 🔬 Empirical Evidence and Predictions

### ✅ Verified Applications

**🧬 Biology: T4-lysozyme**
- Strong negative correlation (r ≈ -0.76) between thermodynamic stability and O(ℰ)
- Proteins evolve toward minimization of excess complexity while preserving function

**⚛️ Physics: Chladni Figures**
- Complex stable patterns emerge only at O(ℰ) ≈ 0.40–0.45 (local minimum)
- Demonstration of transition to a new ontological plane

**🏛️ Sociodynamics**
- Distributed institutions demonstrate lower ontological coordination load
- Historical analysis shows correlation between O(ℰ) and social system stability

**🧠 Cognitive Sciences: Placebo Effect**
- Shifting ontological model of disease directly affects biology
- Transition to a plane where symptoms are no longer interpreted as pathology
