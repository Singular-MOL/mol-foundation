# Law of Minimal Ontological Load (MOL)

> **A universal meta-law of evolution for complex systems.**
> From protein folding to social dynamics, MOL explains *why* some structures emerge and persist, while others dissolve into chaos.

## üéØ The Core Idea

The **Law of Minimal Ontological Load (MOL)** states that any stable system evolves toward a state where its **ontological load** ‚Äî the non-functional redundancy in its descriptive framework ‚Äî is minimized, while maintaining its informational integrity.

Formally:
`E^* = argmin O(‚Ñ∞) subject to ‚Ñê ‚â• ‚Ñê_min`

In short: **Reality prefers the most economical way of being.**

## üß© The Periodic Table of Meta-Principles

MOL manifests through 11 universal principles:

| Category | Principles | Function |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **DYNAMICS** | PFD, PKV, PDA | Manage system transitions |
| **STRUCTURE** | PFE, PLAO, PNVK | Organize hierarchical systems |
| **INFORMATION** | PDK, PSR, PIPK | Process and compress meaning |
| **TIME/SYMMETRY** | PAA, PID | Break symmetry, direct time |

## üî¨ Evidence Base

- **Biology:** T4-lysozyme stability correlates with minimized O(‚Ñ∞) (r ‚âà -0.76)
- **Physics:** Chladni figures emerge at specific low-O(‚Ñ∞) resonance points  
- **Social Systems:** Distributed institutions show lower coordination costs
- **Cognitive Science:** Placebo effect demonstrates ontological plane shifts

## üõ† Roadmap

1. **Short-term:** Develop quantitative O(‚Ñ∞) metrics
2. **Medium-term:** Formalize "white spots" - Level Synthesis & Teleonomic Economy  
3. **Long-term:** Cross-disciplinary verification
